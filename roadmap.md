# Roadmap

## Duffel integration (test mode)
- [x] Rule-based trip parser + city→IATA/coords map (40 EU cities + Tokyo/New York/Dubai)
- [x] POST /api/trip/parse
- [x] POST /api/trip/search: flights, Stays, Cars (graceful skip), FX to EUR, saved estimates
- [x] 10-minute server cache + 10 searches/IP/hour rate limit
- [x] Hero → real search in the chat animation (min 1.5 s indicator), rows hidden when a part is missing
- [x] Source tags, "Book it all" disabled with launch tooltip, test-mode note
- [x] New copy in en.ts + 13 locale files regenerated
- [x] Verified at 390 px, reduced motion, typecheck

## Blocked
- [ ] Live results need the DUFFEL_API_KEY secret (user adds it in project settings); until then the sample trip shows with a note.

## Done
- Business card for Kitti Fodor in the chosen layout
